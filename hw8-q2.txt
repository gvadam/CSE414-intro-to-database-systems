I first used sqlite to find out what all of the values of d and f(d) are.
The following code outputs two columns: the first column being the out-degree or d value and
the second column is f(d) or the number of cities. In the csv file, I only include all of
the d values and I replicate the values depending on their f(d) value. For example, if a row
contains a d value of 50 and a f(d) value of 2, then in the csv file, there are two 50 values.
I then used excel's built-in functions to create the histogram, setting up the features to
include all the data in buckets.

-- sqlite
WITH first AS (
	SELECT F.origin_city AS city, COUNT(*) AS numFlights
	FROM FLIGHTS AS F
	GROUP BY F.origin_city
)
SELECT O.numFlights AS d, COUNT(*) AS fd
FROM first AS O
GROUP BY O.numFlights
ORDER BY O.numFlights;
