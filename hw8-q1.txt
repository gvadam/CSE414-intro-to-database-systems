Using sqlite3, I typed up the code below after typing up .mode .csv, .headers off, .separator
", ", and .once hw8-q1.csv
The following code simply splits up the parts of the question into separate tables.

WITH incoming AS ( 
	SELECT F.dest_city AS in_city, COUNT(*) AS inc
	FROM FLIGHTS AS F
	GROUP BY F.dest_city
),
outgoing AS (
	SELECT F.origin_city AS out_city, COUNT(*) AS out
	FROM FLIGHTS AS F
	GROUP BY F.origin_city
),
influxT AS (
	SELECT I.in_city AS cityName, (I.inc - O.out) AS influx
	FROM incoming AS I, outgoing AS O
	WHERE I.in_city = O.out_city
),
maxAndMin AS (
	SELECT MAX(T.influx) as maxI, MIN(T.influx) as minI
	FROM influxT AS T
),
maxCity AS (
	SELECT I.cityName AS name, M.maxI AS max
	FROM influxT AS I, maxAndMin As M
	WHERE I.influx = M.maxI
),
minCity AS (
	SELECT I.cityName AS name, M.minI AS min
	FROM influxT AS I, maxAndMin As M
	WHERE I.influx = M.minI
)
SELECT M.name, M.max, N.name, N.min
FROM maxCity AS M, minCity AS N;
