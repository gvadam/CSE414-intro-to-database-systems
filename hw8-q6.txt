I used sql++ for this question. I first copied and pasted all the json code for Prizes and Laureates and placed
them in a file called "everything.adm". The format of that file follows this:
   { 
       "everything": {
          "prizes": [
              ...
           ],
          "laureates": [
              ...
           ]
       }
   }
I used a free website that formatted the json code in a readable format. 
I then opened AsterixDB and ran the following code:
   DROP DATAVERSE noble IF EXISTS;
   CREATE DATAVERSE noble;
 
   CREATE TYPE noble.prizeType AS {auto_id:uuid };
   CREATE DATASET noble.prize(prizeType)  PRIMARY KEY auto_id AUTOGENERATED;
   LOAD DATASET noble.prize USING localfs
         (("path"="127.0.0.1:///C:/Users/adamg/OneDrive/Desktop/CSE414/cse414-hw8-adamg28/data/everything.adm"),("format"="adm"));

Lastly, I ran the following sql++ code to get the answers.
   WITH idList AS (
	SELECT DISTINCT y.category AS category, z.id AS id
	FROM noble.prize x, x.everything.prizes y, y.laureates z),
   genderList AS (
	SELECT y.id AS idd, y.gender AS gender
	FROM noble.prize x, x.everything.laureates y),
   catGender AS (
	SELECT I.category AS category, G.gender AS gender
	FROM idList I, genderList G
	WHERE I.id = G.idd AND G.gender != 'org'),
   total AS (
	SELECT C.category AS category, COUNT(C.gender) AS total
	FROM catGender C
	GROUP BY C.category ),
   female AS (
	SELECT C.category AS category, COUNT(C.gender) AS totalFemale
	FROM catGender C
	WHERE C.gender = 'female'
	GROUP BY C.category)
   SELECT T.category, ROUND(F.totalFemale/T.total * 100) AS percent
   FROM total T, female F
   WHERE T.category = F.category;
